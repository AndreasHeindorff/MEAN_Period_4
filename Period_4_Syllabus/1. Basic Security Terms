1. Explain basic security terms like authentication, authorization, confidentiality, integrity, SSL/TLS and provide
examples of how you have used them.

Authentication:
Authentication is a confirmation of identity. In computer science, verifying a person's identity is often required to
access to confidential data or systems.

Authorization:
Authorization refers to access rights related to information and such.
For example: The admin is authorized to delete user accounts, but user accounts are not authorized to do so.

Confidentiality:
Involves a set of rules or a promise that limits access or places restrictions on certain types of information.

Integrity:
Maintaining and assuring the accuracy and completeness of data over its entire life-cycle. This means that data cannot
be modified in an unauthorized or undetected manner.

SSL/TLS:
SSL is a protocol by which enables services that communicate over the Internet securely.
TLS is newer and more secure than SSL.
